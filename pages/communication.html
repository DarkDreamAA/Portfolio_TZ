        The <b style="font-weight: bold;">Communication</b> course is composed of five modules in which we study 
        protocols for IoT networks. It was an interesting module with a lot of different subjects around the IoT.
        We study energy harvesting, wireless communication, security of the networks and evolution in these fields.<br/>
        The <mark>first module</mark> concerns the main <b style="font-weight: bold;">communication protocols</b>
        for connected objects towards sutdents presentations.
        Furthermore, we have studied precisely the MAC layer and the various associated protocols. 
        This course is directly related to the one concerning the evolution of cellular networks (3G to 6G) and their
        characteristics. <br/>
        The <mark>second module</mark>, is about <b style="font-weight: bold;">digital wireless communication for connected objects</b>.
         we learnt modulation techniques used for wireless protocols. <br/>
         The <mark>third module</mark> is about <b style="font-weight: bold;">energy for connected objects</b>. 
         We saw how to energy management and storage for connected objects, but also energy recovery from different sources. <br/>
        The <mark>fourth module</mark> is about <b style="font-weight: bold;">security for network of connected objects</b>. 
        The concepts introduced revolve around the security management of all types of connected devices and 
        the problems that arise from them.<br/>
        Finally, the <mark>fifth module</mark> is about <b style="font-weight: bold;">emerging networks</b>.
        We saw tehnologies that can be interesting for current networks. Furthermore, we talk about the SDN (a network architecture 
        model) and LISP (network protocol).<br/>
        
        In this page you will find all the information about the different modules and the technical challenges around them. 
        I also highlight the knowledge and skills acquired during this entire course.

      <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"> 
        Throughout the course sessions, there were a lot of assignments in order to evaluate how well we understood the notions.
        Indeed, We conducted group research (consisting of a written report and an oral presentation) for which we had to choose 
        among the WSN protocols proposed: LoRA, Sigfox, BLE, ZigBee, NB-IoT and M2M.
        We chose to focus our study on the <b style="font-weight: bold;"> Narrow-Band IoT</b> (NB-IoT) in a 5G context. 
        We explain the characteristics of the physical layer and the radio interface (frequency, modulations...), 
        as well as the description of the MAC layer. Also, power consumption and safety around this protocol were discussed.</br>
        I also realized a second deliverable individually this time on the MAC protocols dedicated to the WSN 
        (this work is explained in the Technical part).<br/>

      </div>
      <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"> 
        The Emerging networks module focused on current network advances. Moreover, I was able to see in detail the technologies
        SDN (Software Defined Networks) and NFV (Network Functions Virtualisation) which are in smooth to revolutionize in the 
        long term the architectures of the networks of the operators and allow new services to be deployed much faster and with 
        significantly lower costs. <br/>
        Through two lab sessions, I was able to get an experimental overview of the SDN and everything 
        related to network virtualization. This was an interesting challenge for me, having previously only minimum network bases. <br/>
        Moreover, a knowledge MCQ on the concepts covered during the course sessions allowed me to properly test my understanding
        of the important notions around these networks. The second part of the evaluation of this module was the analysis of a
        scientific paper on SDN technologies for the field of IoT. It was an interesting exercise, the IoT being predominant in 
        our semester courses. <br/>

            This task was challenging, because I do not really have a huge knowledge in networking and communication protocols. 
            I did the security part. This protocol offers services in terms of security in accordance with the requirements of 5G 
            and connected objects. There were not a lot of scientific papers on the subject, but extensive research gathered much 
            of the information on the security mechanisms implemented in a NB-IoT network. Indeed, it is an important service 
            because data is increasingly bound to be altered and cyber-attacks can multiply against connected devices. 
            Furthermore, the presentations of the other protocols allowed me to have an overview of the security services offered 
            by each (authentication mechanism, data encryption...).
            Please find attached our report on the NB-IoT protocol.

        Concerning the study of the MAC protocols dedicated to the WSN, I realized a brief state of the art of each protocol 
        for which I explained their different characteristics at the level of:<br/>
        -	Clock synchronization<br/>
        -	Localization capability<br/>
        -	Security mechanisms<br/>
        -	Nodes mobility<br/>
        In addition, I made a brief comparison of these different MAC protocols.

      </div>
      <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"> 
        This module focused mainly on signal processing, that I already have notions about it thanks to last year. 
        We had a series of labs that focused on Software Defined Radio.
        The idea with SDR is to use a minimum of hardware components, the main features will be implemented by software 
        (demodulation process...). So theses operations are made with a single device, and the signal decoding process
        is done by software. <br/>
        The main objective of the labs is to focus on the reception of real communication signals. 
        First of all, we have studied theoretically the behavior of the USRP, by using signal processing formulas,
        about how demodulation, signal amplitude and data transmission are made. Then, we made an analysis of the receiver.
        We studied a FM broadcasting record with the GNURadio development environment. Finally, we focused on the reception
        of VOLMET messages in AM. <br/>
        To achieve these goals, we made different signal processing: filtering (unwanted frequencies, some noise), frequency transposition...
        With the GNUradio GUI, we can easily implement these operations. I didn't have many difficulties to understand this software
        because it was close to Matlab that I used every year.

      <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"> 
        During the "3G to 6G" module, we were able to discuss technological developments concerning cellular networks and future ambitions.
        I was also able to be made aware of the importance this brings in a more connected society in search of the quality, speed and 
        reliability of wireless communications. The challenge was to achieve a state-of-the-art 5G technology and the contribution of 
        the Swedish telecommunications company, Ericsson. We focused our analysis on the IoT world. Through this research work, 
        I was able to soak up improved features on the network connection that 5G brings. Below is our presentation for more details.

      <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"> 
        During the course sessions, I had an overview of energy harvesting storage, both electrochemical and electrostatic storages.
        Indeed, depending on the application field (aeronautic...), we can choose primary or secondary batteries, and also associate them with a serial 
        or parallel association in order to fulfill the storage requirements. Then, I again saw in details the use and characteristics
        of supercapacitors for the electrostatic storage purpose. For instance they can be use in cars, in association with the battery, 
        for the start of the vehicle (acceleration...). <br/>
        Moreover, we were aware of some IoT use cases, on engineering fields. At the end, we were a written test in order to put
        into practice our understanding in batteries and supercapacitors uses and the energy storage process. There was no particular
        difficulties for me because I have already had background knowledge thanks to last year Energy sources course. <br/>

            This course came at the end of the semester. It gathered a lot of networking notions applied for the IoT field. <br/><br/>
            For the "<i>Protocols and communication</i>" modules, I have acquired the required skills. Indeed, thanks to my basic knowledge 
            of networks that I was able to develop in the 3rd and 4th year during a dedicated module, I could not have great 
            difficulty in understanding the theoretical notions concerning communication protocols, the emergence of new network 
            architectures, and to apply them in concrete labs. Moreover, concerning the energy of the IoT systems, having already 
            been made aware last year on the sources of energy for the onboard systems, I did not have any difficulty in this part 
            of the module. <br/><br/>
            However, the "<i>security for IoT networks</i>" was more challenging for me. I didn't have enough theoretical knowledge about 
            security mechanisms at the communications level. However, with the help of colleagues from the IT and network sectors, 
            I was able to understand in depth the security mechanisms to be applied to IoT needs.
